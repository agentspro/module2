A retrieval mechanism, which retrieves relevant documents or information from an external knowledge source.\n2. A generation component, which takes the retrieved information and generates coherent, contextually relevant responses.\n\nIn other words, RAG works by first searching for relevant documents or information related to a user's query, and then using that information to generate a response.",

They leverage dense representations to capture contextual relationships within text, enhancing retrieval accuracy and generation fluency.\n\nSparse retrievers, on the other hand, capture different relevance features and can benefit from each other by leveraging complementary relevance information. They are often used in conjunction with pre-training language models (PLMs) to learn term weights for enhanced sparse retrieval.\n\nIn essence, dense retrievers rely on complex, dense representations of text, while sparse retrievers focus on capturing specific, sparse features that complement each other.",

      "answer": "Based on the provided documents, I can explain the concept of Corrective RAG (CRAG).\n\nCorrective RAG (CRAG) is a method proposed to self-correct the results of retriever and improve the utilization of documents for augmenting generation. It involves using a lightweight retrieval evaluator to assess the overall quality of retrieved documents for a query, returning a confidence degree based on which different knowledge retrieval actions can be triggered.\n\nIn other words, CRAG aims to improve the robustness of generation by identifying and correcting errors in the retrieved documents, thereby providing more accurate and informative results. This is achieved through the use of a retrieval evaluator that evaluates the relevance and reliability of the retrieved documents, and triggers additional retrieval actions if necessary.\n\nIt appears that CRAG is an extension of the original RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) method, which was initially text-based. The concept has since expanded to include multimodal models that integrate RAG concepts across various domains, such as image.",

The evaluation objectives and experimental settings mentioned in Document 5 do not explicitly list common metrics for assessing RAG performance, suggesting that the specific metrics used might be tailored to LightRAG's architecture.\n\nHowever, considering the general context provided by Document 1, it is likely that MAPK, precision, recall, RMSE, and MSE are also applicable to assessing RAG performance.",
