Query Process: The natural language query is converted into an embedding, which is used for retrieval. \n4. Generation Model: Retrieved documents are then passed to a large language model to generate an answer.\n\nNote that Document 5 mentions two separate processes, Index and Query, which are also referred to as the \"Index process\" in other documents.",

This serves as a crucial component in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), contributing to informative generation by reviewing and evaluating the relevance of the retrieved documents.\n\nIn essence, CRAG is designed to improve the robustness of generation by correcting errors in retrieval and providing more accurate results, which ultimately enhances the quality of generated text.",
